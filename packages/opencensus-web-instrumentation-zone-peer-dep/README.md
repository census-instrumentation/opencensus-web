# OpenCensus Web instrumentation zone for user interaction tracing
[![Gitter chat][gitter-image]][gitter-url]

*For overview and usage info see the main [OpenCensus Web readme][oc-web-readme-url].*

This package generates OpenCensus Web model spans based on user interactions 
coming after initial page loads. This uses the library 
[Zone.js](https://github.com/angular/zone.js/) to generate those spans.

The library is in alpha stage and the API is subject to change.

## Overview

This package adds `Zone.js` as a peer dependency as your application 
might already be dependent on it. This is the case, for example, with 
application on `Angular` as this already imports it. 

### How it works?

In general, `Zone.js` is in charge of intercepting all the tasks running in an application,
then, OC Web mokey-patches the functions `runTask`, `scheduleTask` and `cancelTask` to intercept
and know when a task is running, being scheduled or canceled. 
To start a new interaction, in the `runTask` monkey-patch, OC Web checks if the `task.eventName`
corresponds to a *click* and the element that triggered the task either has a `data-ocweb-id` attibute
or can be named with a *CSS selector*. In case those conditions are true, a new `Zone` and `rootSpan` are 
started to measure the interaction.

#### Detecting user interaction stability 
To be able to know when the interactions finishes, the number of tasks the interaction 
triggers has to be tracked. The count of tasks is incremented when a task is scheduled 
(e.g. `setTimeout` is called) or the interaction just started, and the count decrements 
when a task finishes running (e.g. `setTimeout` finished running the callback) or is canceled. 
When the count of tasks is 0, the interaction is maybe complete, it is *maybe* because a 
`setTimeout` of 0 ms is queued to actually complete the interaction in case there are no more scheduled tasks
ahead. In case there are more tasks ahead, this task is canceled to allow keep counting the tasks.
If the interaction is complete, the `rootSpan` ends and is exported to the OC Agent.

#### Concurrent interactions
To keep track of concurrent interactions, that is interactions triggered by either different DOM elements or 
the same element (e.g. click several times the same button). A `Map` is used to keep track of all interactions.

#### Handling with multiple event handlers for the same interaction
Also, as in some cases, elements have multiple event handlers or some frameworks might trigger 
several events for the same interaction. This is the case for React, that triggers several click events 
for a button if the user only clicked once. OC Web creates a *flag* that is set when a new interaction 
is detected and reset it after *50 ms* using `setTimeout`. Having this flag means that all 
handled events happening within 50 milliseconds will be associated to the same interaction. 
After 50 milliseconds, if a handled event is detected, this will cause the creation of a new user interaction.

For more details see the [src/interaction_tracker.ts][interaction-tracker-url] and 
[src/on-page-interaction-stop-watch.ts][on-page-interaction-url] files containing the source code.

### What kind of tasks are tracked during the user interaction?
There are three kinds of tasks:
- *MicroTask*: used for doing work right after the current task. In this case the Promises are an example of microtasks.
- *MacroTask*: used for doing work later. Such as `setTimeout` or `setInterval`.
- *EventTask*: used for listening on some future event. This may execute zero or more times, with an unknown delay.

Several tasks might run after a user interaction has started, such as a `setTimeout` or HTTP requests. In order to detect 
the stability of an interaction, OC web only counts the *MicroTasks* and *MacroTasks* as these tasks tell the actual work 
the interaction might have. We do not mind about *EventTasks* as they only correspond to events happening and do 
not do network calls or long code executions. However, OC Web does not count periodic tasks such as `setInterval` as 
they will be called repeatedly, which would cause the interaction to never finish and would be impossible 
to measure the stability of the interaction.

### How are route transitions detected and named?

Another kind of traced user interactions are the route transitions within the web page. Route transitions are named as 
*'Navigation /path/to/page'*. 
For this case, OC Web monkey-patches the browser’s [History API][history-api-url].
This allows to OC Web detecting all route transitions in a user interaction and give the right name to the interaction. 
The way it works is identifying the currently running interaction by getting the current interaction from the active Zone 
when the History API methods (e.g. pushState) are called.

See the [src/history-api-patch.ts][history-api-patch-url] file.

### Intercepting XHR calls and joing browser data

OC Web intercepts XHR calls generated by a user interaction. A new `childSpan` is created to measure the XHR and 
the Trace Context Header in the W3C Trace Context format is sent along the XHR.

To intercept XHRs, OC Web checks if the `task.target` is an instance of `XMLHttpRequest`.  If that is the case, uses the 
method `setRequestHeader()` to send the `traceparent` header as long as the XHR URL is same origin or matches the 
regular expression given in `ocTraceHeaderHostRegex` global variable.
The XHR span has to start once `send()` is called but the actual `send` has not run yet. For that, this method is monkey-patched
to dispatch an event telling the interaction tracker the span has to start a new XHR span, the name for the span will be the URL pathname.

When the XHR has ended (`readyState` is `DONE`) the XHR span is ended to get the total duration of the XHR. Additionally, some 
attributes are added to the span, such as the *HTTP status* (e.g. 200) code and *HTTP method* (e.g. POST) used for the request. 
To obtain the *HTTP method*, the `XMLHttpRequest.open()` method is monkey-patched and adds this data to the XHR object. 

See the [src/monkey-patching.ts][monkey-patching-url] and [src/xhr-interceptor.ts][xhr-interceptor-url] files for details.

In addition to the childSpan for the XHR, OC Web attaches the [Resource Performamce Timing API][resource-timing-url] 
data to the span.
This data is retrieved by `performance.getEntriesByType(‘resource’)` where the resource timing entries will provide that kind of data. 
However, this data does not correlate every entry  with a specific XHR object and some of those XHRs may 
trigger an additional request related to *CORS preflight*. Also, there might be several user interactions being 
tracked at the same time sending requests to the same URL, creating several entries in the Performance Resource Array with the same name.
To solve this, an algorithm is created which in general filters out this data and looks for the best entries fitting within the 
XHR span. 

For details in the algorithm see [src/perf-resource-timing-selector.ts][performance-selector-url].


## Usage

### Custom spans
In addition to automatic user interaction tracing, it is possible to create 
your own spans for the tasks or code involved in a user interaction.
Here is an example for JavaScript

```javascript
import { tracing } from '@opencensus/web-instrumentation-zone-peer-dep';

function handleClick() {
  // Start child span which will be child of the current root span on the current interaction.
  // To make sure the span is attached to the root span, add this in code that the button is running.
  const childSpan = tracing.tracer.startChildSpan({
    name: 'name of your child span'
  });
  // Do some operation...
  // Finish the child span at the end of it's operation
  childSpan.end();
}

// Create a fake button to point out the custom span is created in the click handler.
const button = document.createElement('button');
button.onclick = handleClick;
```
Check the [user interaction client example][client-example-url] which instruments the package and 
create some custom spans.
